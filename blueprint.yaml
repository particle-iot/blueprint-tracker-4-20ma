introduction: |
  This tutorial includes hardware and software for connecting a 4-20mA current loop sensor to the Tracker One using the M8 connector.
description: |
  This project demonstrates how to connect 4-20mA current loop sensors to the Tracker One using the M8 connector. It shows circuits for:
  - 24V boost converter (from CAN_5V)
  - 30 mA current limiter
  - TVS protection

  The single-port design is ideal for use cases requiring reliable sensor readings over a single 4-20mA channel. Power can be supplied from the Trackerâ€™s LiPo battery or USB, providing flexibility in deployment. Example applications include remote environmental monitoring and industrial data logging.

  This tutorial covers both hardware and software setup, guiding users through configuring and reading data from 4-20mA sensors connected to the Tracker One.
